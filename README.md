# Web-Design-Challenge (Week 11 Homework)

### This repo contains my homework for week 11, which was the web design challenge.

### The repo contains the folder WebVisualizations.  Within the folder you will find:

#### 
1. resources folder:  This contains the cities weather data in the csv file.  This file was used to generate the html file using Pandas.  This html file was used in the table definition of the Data tab on the website I created.

2. visualisations folder:  This folder contains the four charts used on the website.  These were created as part of an earlier homework assignment.
